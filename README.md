## OOPS 3rd SEM PROJECT
My Project for 3rd sem DTU

# ProTeams - Project Management App

An app which allows you to coordinate easily with the members of your team while you and your team are working day and night on any project. 
* You can create a new board for each project or multiple for boards for the same project, as you like. 
* In each board you will have an option to create different lists signifying the various tasks to be completed in the project. 
* You can add as many members you want to for the project in a particular board from the pool of all the registered users. 
* Each list can further contain many cards which can help break each task in subtasks and multiple users among those who have been already assigned to the board can be assigned to each and every card according to your requirement. 
* Whenever you add members to any board, that member will receive a notification automatically telling him that he has been added to that particular board by you and can start working on it asap. 
* You can add a photo to each of your boards as well as your profile for easy identification by your team members. 
* Name of each list and each card in any list can be changed afterwards too according to your preference.
